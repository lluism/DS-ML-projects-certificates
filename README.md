# DS-ML-projects-certificates

This repository contains many small certificates for fully-completed courses on specific topics in ML and DS from DataCamp. 
There is also the general data scientist certificate I obtained after the successful completion of two knowledge and 
one practical exams. See the pdfs of the certificate and the white paper describing the skills and requirements covered 
in it, as well as the ipython notebook of the practical exam (after submission I tried several additional things 
at the end of the notebook that may currently be unfinished).

There are also several notebooks of projects on various topics from Data Camp that I completed for further learning and practice.
